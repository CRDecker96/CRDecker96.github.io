## What I learned:

  1. Atom and Github

  * I ran through the Github and had a prior interaction of the Github.

  * I have ran atom in the past so I have the programs.

  * Creating the files and how they work on Sourcetree was a bugger but I got it.

  * Pushing the new folder to the Repository and then turning in the assignment(late), due to some tech problems.
