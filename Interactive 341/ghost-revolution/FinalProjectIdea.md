I plan on creating a game that will be using sprites as Mario and the game will a game form of doodle jump. Or try using the combination of two games to get a decently simple rendition of a game that works smoothly and has simple relative sprites that are able to check relative locations to each other.

I would create a class character that is a sprite of an edited version of Mario. I will have to find the rate of gravity, apply that to Mario, then have the bounce active on each platform.
Creating the background of a sprite that is continually looped with the movement of marios jump. 
Then the platforms will need to be set in a range relative to Mario and his bounce. Then the platform will have random after one jump the platform will disappear. 
Apply each class into a sketch so the game will be created, upload images function will need to be applied to the classes, understanding range of platforms, and the rate of gravity along with the bounce will be my focus throughout the project.
