In my code I attempted to make a very simple game, that was a somewhat combination of Asteroid and Pac Man. The start of this project was the hardest part, all my ideas were to complex for my abilities, so I nailed down a simple idea. I began pulling sprites and images and then figuring out how to create a variable for each image, then in the preload function getting them to load. Then creating a class for the Ghosts and Pacman, then I had to create a constructor for the Fireballs.

I intended to create three ghosts at random x points along the window width. Then applying case breaks after each ghost would disappear. For PacMan I made a sprite of a ship and made three different ones (right, middle, left) for each movement. Each movement using the arrow keys would display the image being called, determining then returning to the center image. The contact between each two objects, relative to the location of Pacman, If Pacmanâ€™s coordinates assigned made contact with a fireball it was then collected, score would increase by one, and a sound alert of the capture. If ghost made contact a sound of a gun would be created and a heart would decrease in value by one.  Once the three lives are gone the game would reach an end and user refresh page for new game.
